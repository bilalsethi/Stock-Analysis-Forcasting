# Stock-Analysis-Forcasting
This project focuses on stock price and volume analysis, forecasting trends, and considering external factors like interest rates, gold prices, and the NASDAQ index, which influence stock market behavior. Using Python, the project fetches stock data, including price and volume, from sources like Yahoo Finance and TradingView. The data is cleaned, transformed, and visualized through techniques such as histograms and box plots. In addition to analyzing price trends and correlations, the project calculates technical indicators like moving averages and volatility. ARIMA modeling is used for stock price forecasting, providing valuable insights for market predictions. Based on the analysis, the model suggests actions such as buying, selling, or holding/neutral.
